## What It Is

OpenAPI Generator is an open-source tool that automatically creates clients, servers, and documentation from OpenAPI specifications (versions 2.0 and 3.x).

## Primary Uses

- Generating client code to interact with APIs that expose OpenAPI documents
- Creating server stubs for rapid backend development
- Producing API documentation in multiple formats
- Converting between OpenAPI specification versions

## Main Features & Capabilities

### 1. Client Generation
Supports 50+ client generators across numerous programming languages, allowing developers to easily build API consumers.

### 2. Server Development
Offers server stubs for 40+ different languages and technologies, including Java, Kotlin, Go, and PHP.

### 3. Specialized Generators
Includes tools for generating Apache2 configurations, MySQL schemas, and GraphQL schemas beyond traditional code.

### 4. Documentation Output
Converts API metadata into distributable formats like HTML and Cwiki.

### 5. Customization
Features customizable Mustache-based templates and support for derivative generators.

### 6. Integration Flexibility
Accessible through multiple workflows—Maven, Gradle, Docker, npm, Homebrew, and SaaS platforms.

### 7. Active Community
Maintains an engaged user base and contributes through open-source collaboration channels.

## Key Benefit

Instead of manually writing repetitive code to consume or implement APIs, you define your API once in an OpenAPI specification (YAML/JSON), and the tool generates all the boilerplate code automatically. This ensures consistency between your API spec and implementation, saves development time, and reduces errors.
